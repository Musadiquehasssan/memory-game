# Memory Game

For my Udacity course, I built a memory game where players click cards to find matching pairs that stay open. When all cards are matched, a popup appears congratulating the player and showing a score from 1–3 stars, the time taken, and the number of moves used.


## How to Play:

Game Objective: Match all the cards to win.

1. Click two cards to reveal them. If they match, move on to find another pair; if not, try again.

2. Continue matching pairs until all cards are face up.

3. Once completed, a congratulatory alert appears showing your score, time, and number of moves. If a card issue occurs, use the restart button in the top-right corner.

4. From the alert window, select “Go Again!” to replay and aim for a better score.
